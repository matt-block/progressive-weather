/**
 * Container column that maintains a reasonable width across multiple
 * screen sizes to keep its content readable and comfortable to use.
 *
 * On wider screens (e.g. desktop monitors) it will be narrower than the
 * available screen width to prevent both text and general UI from
 * spreading excessively, while on smaller screen sizes its width will be
 * close or equal to the total available screen width.
 *
 * It is not intended to be nested within one another.
 * Instead, it must be used within another component as a wrapper around
 * its content.
 *
 * It is preferred that all main components (e.g. header navigation bars,
 * footers, pages, hero components) use Container so that ultimately all
 * content visible to the user is virtually contained in one unique column.
 *
 * @example
 * // A nav bar with background that stretches across all the screen width.
 * <nav style={{ width: '100%', backgroundColor: 'green' }}>
 *   <Container>
 *     // menu links, home button, login, etc.
 *   </Container>
 * </nav>
